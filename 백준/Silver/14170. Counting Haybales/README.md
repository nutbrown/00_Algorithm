### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has just arranged his N haybales (1≤N≤100,000) at various points along the one-dimensional road running across his farm. To make sure they are spaced out appropriately, please help him answer Q queries (1≤Q≤100,000), each asking for the number of haybales within a specific interval along the road.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The next line contains N distinct integers, each in the range 0…1,000,000,000, indicating that there is a haybale at each of those locations.</p>

<p>Each of the next Q lines contains two integers A and B (0≤A≤B≤1,000,000,000) giving a query for the number of haybales between A and B, inclusive.</p>
